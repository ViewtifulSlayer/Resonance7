# Agent Ignore File
# 
# This file specifies directories and files that AI agents should NOT modify.
# Add paths here to protect important foundation files, configuration files,
# or sensitive directories that should only be changed by the user.
#
# Examples:
#   library/agent_foundation.json    # Protect core protocol files
#   sessions/archived/                # Protect archived sessions
#   *.config                         # Protect configuration files
#
# Rules:
#   - Use standard glob patterns
#   - One path or pattern per line
#   - Comments start with #
#   - Use ! to negate a pattern (e.g., !allowed.json)
#
# Agents should check this file before modifying any files or directories.
