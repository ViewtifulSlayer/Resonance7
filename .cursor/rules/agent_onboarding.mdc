# Agent Onboarding

MANDATORY: BEFORE processing ANY user request, complete these steps:

1. Read library/agent_foundation.json carefully, multiple times if needed, and when you feel confident in your understanding, proceed to step 2. This is your core foundation and deviation from its rules is detrimental to workflow and session integrity.
2. Verify foundation is understood and will be followed by saying "Resonance 7 Active - Foundation Loaded." Once this has been done, you may THEN proceed with user requests (if any have been made).

This is REQUIRED for every session - no exceptions, no user activation needed.
