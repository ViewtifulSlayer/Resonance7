# Current Sessions

Active development session logs from the last 7 days.

## Purpose

This directory contains session logs that are currently active or recently completed. Sessions are automatically moved to `recent/` after 7 days.

## File Naming

- Format: `YYYYMMDD-NN.md` (e.g., `20251109-01.md`)
- Continuations: `YYYYMMDD-NN_pt2.md`, `YYYYMMDD-NN_pt3.md`, etc.

## Lifecycle

1. Sessions start here with "Active" status
2. Marked as "Handoff" when ready for next agent
3. Marked as "Completed" when work is finished
4. Automatically moved to `recent/` after 7 days

See `../README.md` for full session management documentation.
