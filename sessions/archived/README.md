# Archived Sessions

Monthly zip archives of completed session logs.

## Purpose

This directory contains compressed monthly archives of session logs. Archives are created automatically from sessions in `recent/`.

## Archive Format

- Format: `YYYY-MM.zip` (e.g., `2025-11.zip`)
- Contains: All session logs from that month
- Source: Sessions moved from `recent/` directory

## Lifecycle

1. Monthly archives are created from `recent/` sessions
2. Archives are stored here for long-term retention
3. Very old archives (90+ days) can be cleaned up if needed

See `../README.md` for full session management documentation.
