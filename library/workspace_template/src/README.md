# Source Code

Main application source code.

## Purpose

This directory contains the primary source code for the project. Organize code by:
- Feature modules
- Component layers (e.g., models, views, controllers)
- Service domains
- Package structure

## Best Practices

- Follow Python package conventions (use `__init__.py` for packages)
- Keep modules focused and cohesive
- Document public APIs and interfaces
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
