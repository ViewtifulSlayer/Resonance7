# .agent-mode File

**Status**: Template for future feature (Phase 2 - not yet implemented)

## What This Is

`.agent-mode.example` is a **template file** showing the structure of the agent mode persistence file.

## Current Status

**Persistence is NOT implemented yet.** This is planned for Phase 2.

## Current Behavior

- Agents auto-detect mode based on project state
- Use `/agents [type]` command to set mode per session
- Mode is session-specific (doesn't persist)

## When Persistence Is Implemented

To use this template:
1. Rename: `mv .agent-mode.example .agent-mode` (remove `.example`)
2. Edit the `mode` field to your desired default
3. The agent will read this file on session start

## Auto-Detection (Current Default)

If no `.agent-mode` file exists:
- New project → **Initializer**
- Has knowledge_base/ but no src/ → **Researcher**  
- Has src/ with code → **Coder**
- Default → **Coder**
